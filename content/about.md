# About

Hi my name is [Caleb Schoepp](https://calebschoepp.com), in the summer of 2019 I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease which obviously changed how I eat when I travel. Suddenly I had a desire to try all the best gluten-free places when I was in a new city. Often times these one off visits gave me chances to eat foods I love but haven't had in years like crÃªpes or fried chicken.

Finding these places can be hard though. It takes coming through an assortment of blog posts, Yelp reviews, and Google Maps listings to find the best places. These resources are good but I they're not without issues. Whether that's too many ads or too much backstory or even just restaurants without gluten-free options being listed.

I figured that I could throw my hat in the ring and provide a resource that others looking for great gluten-free food might find helpful.

## Goals

These are the goals that are driving the development of this website and the favorites that I share.

<!-- TODO: Figure out how to put these in shortcodes -->

<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Remain ad and promotion free
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>I've made this because I thought it would be fun and it is a resource that I wish existed. I have no intentions of making money from this.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Share only firsthand experiences
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>I'm not interested in sharing about places I haven't been to but have heard about. I think the places I share will be more meaningful if I've actually been there myself.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Share only places I would actually recommend
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Having eaten somewhere that happened to have gluten-free food is not enough to actually share it. The threshold should be if a friend of mine was looking for gluten-free food in a city would this be on my shortlist of recommendations.</p>

## Non-Goals

These are the goals that I'm explicitly not trying to achieve with this website.

<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Support languages other than English
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>I only speak english and I don't have the resources to translate everything.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Always be up to date
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>This is something I do in my free time so it's not going to be perfect. Furthermore, some of these places I visited once years ago on a trip and I probably won't ever return to them so it is likely the information will become outdated.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Cater to vegan or dairy-free
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>I don't go out of my way to eat at places that support this so I have little to say on it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Be an exhaustive list of all gluten-free places
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>Since I only want to share the best of my firsthand experiences this website will inevitably not be an exhaustive list of all gluten-free places.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200">
      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Provide specific information on cross-contamination concerns
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p>I don't want to be responsible for scoping out the specifics of this information. I leave this up to you when you eat at these places. See the disclaimer for more.</p>
