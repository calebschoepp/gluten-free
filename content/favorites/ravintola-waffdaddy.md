Ravintola WaffDaddy is located in a mall food court that is full of boutique restaurants. They offer an entirely gluten-free menu of both sweet and savory waffle creations. I went there for lunch and had the eggs benedict waffle and chose the cold-smoked salmon as a topping over pork ribs. I thought the presentation was great and it tasted great too. The waffle was a little less crisp than I expected it to be though.

To polish it off I tried one of their dessert waffles. I chose the cinnamon sugar waffle that was topped with homemade pistachio ice cream. I enjoyed the food here enough that I tried to go back for dinner but they were closed by the time I got there. I'll have to try again next time I'm in Helsinki.
