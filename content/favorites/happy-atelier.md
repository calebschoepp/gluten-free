Based on my research Happy Atelier seems like the preeminent gluten-free bakery in Stockholm and it held up to my expectations. They offered a reasonable spread of sweet and salty treats. Pictured above were the cinnamon bun and vanilla buns I tried. Or as they call them kanelbulle and vaniljbulle. I thought both of these were fantastic. The vanilla bun was fresh out of the oven and the warm custard was delicious.

I also had this cute little almond cake. The official name is a financier. This was really good but probably my least favorite thing I tried here.

On the savory side of things I got to try their focaccia. It was amazing! This is evident from the fact that I couldn't wait to take a bite out of it before taking a picture. One of my fondest memories of Genoa, Italy was the fresh focaccia and this is the best I've had since then.
