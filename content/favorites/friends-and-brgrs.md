Friends & Brgrs is a burger restaurant chain found throughout Finland that prides itself on "handmade food from the best ingredients". I ate here on the suggestion that they had really tasty gluten-free chicken fingers â€” they were indeed delicious. I did find the topped fries pictured above a little underwhelming though.

I enjoyed my first meal so much that I came back for more another day. This time I opted for the Double Friends Burger and normal fries. They're able to serve all burgers as gluten-free at no extra charge. The gluten-free bun reminded me a bit of an english muffin and was really good. The burger itself was great quality meat and the melted cheese and crispy onions added a lot. This was definitely one of the better burgers I've had.
