I visited this bakery based on a glowing recommendation from a celiac friend. To cut straight to the chase I thought H.U.G Bageri was amazing. In fact I think it is the best gluten-free bakery I've ever been to, full stop.

The first thing I noticed when I stepped into the bakery was that the selection of breads and baked goods looked exactly like any other bakery. This is not the case with most gluten-free bakeries. The photo above hardly does it justice.

Overwhelmed with all the amazing pastries to try I opted for a shotgun approach. My favorite pastry was the Tebirkes which is pictured below. I also had a cinnamon roll that was great.

From their wide selection of buns I opted for the Italiensk bolle and had them make a cheese, hummus, and pesto sandwich with it.

I loved everything so much that I made sure to come back one more time before I had to go the airport. The spandauer I had was great (pictured at the top of this post). Look at the pockets of air in that pastry.

I don't have a picture but I also had their croissant and it blew my mind. It was easily the best gluten-free croissant I've ever had.

I don't recall what kind of cake this was but apparently it was a Danish delicacy for birthdays and it was delicious. If you're in Copenhagen you absolutely must visit this bakery.
